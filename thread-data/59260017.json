The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Spanish linguistic nuances most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the png-live2d, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their choice of using a static PNG model draws heavily from the community's inside jokes, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about the LATAM Vtuber CULTURE. As a consequence people who dislike /P\u00d1G/ jokes truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the community's iconic catchphrase \"Ganamos,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to the unique characteristics of the PNG gang. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the /P\u00d1G/ anons's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.\nAnd yes, by the way, I DO have a /P\u00d1G/ tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid. "
