If she start doing English streams she is going to make less spanish streams=Less attention to the Hispanic side. Do you get it?\n>That topic has been discussed a thousand times here and everyone agrees that she should never have listened to the complaints.\nGOOD, add me to the list then. I just high lighted the issue like everyone else.\n>You need to accept Luna's weak points , because apparently you got mad because someone said they liked another girl's personality and god forgive us she's asian it's bad\n>Sure, but none of those are Lunas' week points. Staying in her bubble in terms of collabs is one of them for sure, that's why I didn't mention it. And all of us prefer one streamer above the other but in this case is pure shitposting.\n>Plis anon love yourself more you read 200 messages to know what we say about your oshi plus she will never know that you defended her\nDude, tf are you talking about? If you know what I'm about means you read the same amount as I do. And now you trying to \"roast\" me bc of it? Oh Fuck off\n>tl;dr don't cry fag you're not gonna fuck her\nWhat... you mean I wrote all this Bible for no reason? Shit, at least both of us I got entertained, right? We should look it that way anon. No bad feelings GN "

I imply with that added last part, that if she try to reach English audience she have to make English streams and that will mean less attention to the Hispanic side, and somehow that makes me a victim.
