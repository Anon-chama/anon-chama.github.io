At this point, I'm usually fairly distraught.\nNext, I open my mouth and wash the imaginary semen out. I make sure I gag and splutter, sometimes I even put my fingers down my throat to make sure it's all gone. The final stage is the most emotionally draining part of the entire ordeal.\nI stand up, put my ass under the shower flow, then lean forward and begin to wash the rapist's\nimaginary cum out of my asshole and \"vagina\" (I just pretend). I do this for quite a while, to make\nsure it's all gone.\nThen I collapse on the floor again and just break down hysterically. No girl should ever go through\nwhat I just did, all men are animals.
