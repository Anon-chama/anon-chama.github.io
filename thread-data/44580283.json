I thought that was the reason of her first hiatus, then she came back more motivated.\nThen I thought maybe they told her \"if you're going to continue doing that at least marry that CEO of yours\"\nSo I needed a rival to make it interesting, so I put Rose as another girl who wanted Akira. Why? Because of her 3D without reaching 100k, I knew she had reached it between the two platforms but I ignored it so it fits the rrat.\nSo the idea was to rrat about Rose and Lia fighting over Akira.\nI put them in a rivalry too because at the time those two were doing GFE.
