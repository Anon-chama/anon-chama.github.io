At first, I was ecstatic, but Akira then came along and over the course of two years, he shattered my loyalty, and crushed my passion. He treated them like trash. He had a golden opportunity, untouched audiences, charismatic girls, massive support, but he squandered it. Deceived every talent under his grasp and every fan withing his sight. All i wanted was a sense of belonging to a community that didn't crumble from the inside out, but my love for this hobby was brutally crushed.\nNow, I don't follow my dork Meica, I don't follow cute Nisha, I don't follow sweet Eru, I don't follow adorable Axtre. Not even my Himea or Sezia. I'm just lurking, lurking and waiting for a conclusion to this story. And I can't escape this craving. The only way to heal from this wreckage is to disconnect from it all. But my schizo mind won't subdue. This wont end until Wactor is brought to its knees. Only then can I truly break free from the chains that bind me. Only then I'll be able touch grass.\nI'll never forgive you, Akira. You took away everything from me. "
