Miu is the face of the company, and fans haven't forgotten about the Laila doxxing and the shitty way the situation was handled. It's not fair to her but they are punishing for that.\n2. DDs got tired of her and moved on to other chuubas. Miu has been around the longest so it's affecting her first, in a year the same will happen to Sopa and Luna.\nIf Miu wants more SC she should focus less on her gachikois, not give them special treatment and work on making the streams more enjoyable for everyone.
