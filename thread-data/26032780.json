But I would give you my guess of what I think they truly are off stream.\nMiu: A bit of a degenerate but a very caring and loving person. Very responsible and accountable most of the time. She loves entertaining people and boobs.\nHana: Broken girl and the perfect example of a girl Hikikomori (better off than its male counterpart) A lot of mental problems but still hanging in there.\nLia: A Menhera in real life. She use her body to gain her means. She got a couple of talents but she is aware of her limitations on those said talents and that's the reason she doesn't try to to push further. \nVery stereotypical free woman in Japan but she still have regrets for that and is currently trying to get in rail.\nHina: The cool girl you met back at middle school but in the body of a grown up. She is the kind of extrovert that doesn't fit in in normal social circles. \nGets along well with males and Latinos like \"la profesora\". Not very intelligent and very dependent on others. She's very horny.\nSuzu: I verily watch anything of her. \nLuna: Very Spaniard like. Very bad spoken with a dirty mind like most people but very verbal about this like any spaniard (There's several times we have seen this) Typical girl, socially capable and intelligent enough.\nNot very different from stream but way less toned down. Hard to say how is she in relationships but I don't think she's a whore, she seems to hold some values. \nHimali: Have watch a lot of her but she plays her character perfectly in my perspective. Hard guess. She seems pretty normal but with an out going personality. \nPal: Idk\nYue: The most Japanese like person in Wactor probably.\nItto: Pretty much how she is on stream, that is when she is not in a work environment. But she seems capable to be serious when its needed.\nHimea: Kind of an awkward Argie. Easy to get along with and easy to speak with. She'll talk most of the time. \nNot particularly smart but she knows the ways of the street. Watches a lot of memes. The kind of woman you'll have a high chance to get in bed with depending in certain circumstances. \nShe's currently looking for a men to take care of her. \nBabu: Other people will have a better guess for her "
