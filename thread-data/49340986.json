There's a reason why Hololive didn't go there and Niji KR turned to be just Nijisaji.\nIn 1 month we will be just talking about ex-members anyway, the quit of Seiza was the last nail, even if Himea, for some reason, stay there, the wactor relevancy will fade away, but the story of the only corpo who doxxed her talents will be remembered forever.
