I am going to write the Full story, in hope new /Wactor/ generations understand how all this mess started\n>When the WACTOR server just started, Hina jumped to Talk with her fans from time to time. At first it was cool, and people was relatively okey with it. But shit rapidly went out of control\n>Thing is (and this was specially outrageous the very first months) Wactor Discord Server was a cesspool of Snakes and Grommers. Hina, at the time, was incredibly miserable. She lost her Grandma (who was like her mother) , she was poor, quite dumb and discriminated. Suddenly she got thousand of fans and got super engaged with them\n>Us, normal fans, saw the inevitable End of this Secret talks: one of the Groomers will get to Hina, fall in Love, and once rejected, leak all the info he got to the Public, maybe ending the Company forever\n>So what happened? Well, /Wactor/ started to spread awareness of those Secret calls. Trying to make Akira realize her Idol was being Groomed on the Server. (/Wactor/ got popular precisely for that, because many Wactor fans were angry at Discord for holding secret calls)\n>To our own surprise, Wactor suddenly prohibited those calls, and Hina was never seen again in the Server. The most accepted rrat, is that someone (we are not sure who) managed to contact directly with Akira, and told him about Hina private calls. Then Akira asked Hina to never do those again, and the problem was \"solved\"\n>A ton of time passed with no News. But one day, a weird schizo appeared saying he hated Hina, because she was a Traitor or some shit. He then posted private Discord messages showing Hina talking directly with Faka, a well known Translators and Groomer\n>The popular rrat, is what we feared the most, occured. The group of Groomers got to Hina before the Akira Bann started. They got invited to Private Discord Server, where they got to talk with Hina secretly. Naturally, this evolved in a total shitshow. Everyone was in Love with Hina and were permanently fighting to get her attention\n>One of the losers of this \"\"Love\"\" competition got angry, the other Groomers were more popular than him. In his jealousy, he went to 4chan to denounce Hina was a Cheater and a Fraud. But instead, what he really revealed, was the Groomer were holding secret conversations with Hina. Hina would later explain they were a \"Translator Group\"\n>This was kinda the same time Laila was Suspended. So Hina news ended it up being glossed over by Laila suspension and why she disappeared. With the attention directed to Laila, Hina Translation Group got into obscurity again\n>That is, untill early 2022. When a series of very weird tweets started to appear from Groomers. Hina announced she would stop tweeting in Spanish, now only in Japanese. We could tell something was happening, but weren't sure what\n>A couple of weeks ago, the story made a mayor change. Suddenly, LoyalMiutomo got elected as Main Mod by Akira himself, and many of the Groomers started to abandon the Server (and also demoted from Chat Mods on YouTube)\n>This story is unfolding as speak. So we don't know for sure how it happened, but it seems LoyalMiutomo managed to get incriminating info on the Groomer Team. Thus, making Akira pull the Axe and start cutting heads everywhere. Akira has not much idea on who to trust, but in recompense to LoyalMiutomo for his info, he got promoted from normal user to Main Mod\n>Hina, in the other side, also had personal problems with the Groomers. But we still don't know what happened yet though.\n "
