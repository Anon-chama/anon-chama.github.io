The only good one that I know of is Nara. If you watch his streams he has some really good content and is (I think) the most popular spic pandering male vtuber, and even with that he struggles to get viewers or SC\u00b4s at all.\nSure, it\u00b4s gonna be uncomfortable when they get to collab with the girls, but I don\u00b4t think they will do this too often specially if the number of viewers go down and I can tell you for sure that I won\u00b4t be the only one not watching any of those collabs.\nEven the idiots on Twitter supporting this proyect won\u00b4t be watching them after their debut, we all know they are just white knights and yes-man trying to fit in so they won\u00b4t say their real opinions.\nSo unless they have something very unique to offer, which I highly doubt because of Wactor restrictions, they won\u00b4t succeed at all and hopefully Akira will learn from this mistake. Instead of wasting resources on this stupid shit he should be getting more permissions for the girls, their streams are getting pretty repetitive lately and they are getting out of ideas.\nAnyways, what do you think? For me this is a stillborn proyect which won\u00b4t last for too long "

This is because due to adult circumstances, the 2D model was changed from Note-mama to Yuya-mama, so we had to provide a 3D model to go along with it.\n>If the 2D model had not been changed, there would have been only one 3D model.\n>Next, let's talk about the new outfit (gospank) that was released yesterday.\n>The maid had originally told me that it would take at least half a year for delivery because of YUYAMA's busy schedule. Considering the modeling time, I expected it to take at least a year until the unveiling, so I made the request early to have enough time, but it just so happened that YUYAMA's schedule was not flexible.\n>So I asked for the work early, and it was delivered in three months.\n>So, it's just that what was originally scheduled to be unveiled next year happened to be completed earlier, and we were not originally planning to get two new costumes in one year.\n>Do you understand this too? If you don't understand, let me know and I'll explain it to you.\n>Finally, about the original music.\n>This is because I was explicitly hired as a v-singer when I joined WACTOR.\n>In paid live events, I can only sing original songs basically due to rights issues (there are exceptions).\n>If I want to perform live as a V-singer in the future, I will need at least 3~4 original songs.\n>Conversely, it is difficult to perform at live events if you don't have original songs.\n>I am honestly not good at singing, but since I was hired by the company as a singer, I think it is inevitable that I have more original songs than the other members.\n>I can understand why otaku might think, \"It's not fair that this guy is favored! But I want them to understand that each member has his/her own situation and that he/she is not favored by any means.\n>I mean, you must think Leah is just a small, unpopular guy, right?\n>You guys are right, we should just leave this no big deal guy alone. Don't build up negative feelings for Leah. I want you nerds to just cheer for your own interests and have a good life.\n "
