Lia clapped back and got ratio'd as fuck, then went dead silent for about a week. Started reevaluating how lewd she was being is what people were speculating. But, nah, she came back with some vaguely lewd posts and then full blown hornyposting on her roommate. Ito responded to every one of her vaguely lewd posts with what amounts to \"I told you so.\" And all the fuckin lewdposts got ratio'd also, so Lia started seething on her roommate account, and has had bad blood with Ito ever since.
