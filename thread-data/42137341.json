It has nothing to do with our culture, it's just that big corpos don't see a lot of value in this market so this is what we get. It's not so different from the time before HoloEN was a thing and English speaking fans were always happy when Korone said something or sang a song in English and things like that. Fans are happy to get some scraps, when that's all you can realistically get.\nOf course, in time Cover realized there was a huge market to tap into with the English speaking audience and so they did. I wish they saw the spic audience as a viable market but I'm not so sure they ever will. "
