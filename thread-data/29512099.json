Even if you consider that our region is poorer and has less purchasing power than others, being the first (and so far only) Japanese company to cater to this region means that they could make it big. But what good does it do if they keep hiring talent that doesn't speak a word of Spanish? It makes for awkward streams where the streamer has to keep using Google translate and the audience doesn't understand half of what they're saying.\nAt this point it's obvious that their strategy is to get numbers by pandering to the Spanish speaking audience so that they can then fuck off back to the Japanese and Chinese markets.
