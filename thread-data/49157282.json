She was frantically looking for a door, but the layout of the underground compound wasn't helping. Making split-second decisions to turn left or right, she kept going. Her heart was racing and her lungs were burning but she couldn't stop now, her pursuer couldn't be far behind.\nShe took a right turn and finally came across a well-lit hallway that lead to a wooden door. She remembered the door from when she first arrived at this place, foolishly by her own will. At the time she had taken notice of the door, ornate on both sides with symbols of the night sky and some instruments of torture here and there. That memory seemed so distant now that for a moment she wasn't quite sure it hadn't been a dream. Yet the door from her memory was standing right in front of her eyes. She had no time to waste now.\nShe quickly took the key ring in her hand and got to work. \"Open up, damn it\", she said as she desperately tried every key she had in her hands, which had to number at least a dozen. One by one she tried and one by one she had to discard. Her hands were trembling as she inserted the last one into the keyhole. With a heavy heart she realized that it wouldn't budge, had she missed a key in her desperation? She was about to try every key again when she heard movement behind.\nAt first she couldn't see anything, as her pursuer was still in the dimly lit corridor that lead up to this hallway. The first thing she noticed was the burning red eye looking right at her. The light conditions didn't allow it but she knew the bright blue eye was staring intently at her, too. Then she heard the giggle which in another time would have brought her immense joy, but now seemed menacing and terrifying.\n\"Did you really think I would let the keys laying around like that?\", said a voice from what appeared to be a girl of small stature, but which Yof knew was something else entirely. Something ancient and primordial. The girl moved towards Yof with the confidence of a predator who knows it has its prey cornered. As she stepped into the light, her grey hair and facial features were revealed. Her expressionless face didn't reveal any intentions but Yof knew now not to be deceived by this. The girl had to be angry, why wouldn't she be? Defeated, Yof fell to her knees and looked up to her tormentor.\n\"You know I have to punish you now, don't you?\", the girl said.\n\"Nisha please\", Yof replied, her voice breaking. \"Not the cage\".\n\"We'll see\", she replied, and all went dark...

No, but my autism demanded it. ",
