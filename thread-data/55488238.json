The only QoL improvement I can suggest is to make Himea walk faster, or maybe implement some sort of run button because she feels a little bit sluggish.\nI don't know if it was your intention but I found your game very reminiscent of Adventures of Lolo, specifically the second level I know it reminded me of a level on Lolo so I looked it up. But overall I think you're doing great! ",
