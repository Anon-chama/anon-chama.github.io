I can't post screenshots because this happened many years ago (about 10 or so as you realized, so any normal person would just lose those) and I clearly don't have them anymore. Only people who have known her rm for a very long time and were close to her know who those accounts really belong to and you are just parroting information that can be extremely damaging to both Luna and Lomitos. Certainly, it was an unfortunate discovery, but these accounts do NOT belong to Luna. \nOver the years since she was very young she had multiple severe impersonation problems and from the way the owner of that account is writting I can assure you that those are some of them. I used to be close to her and she is one of the sweetest girl I have ever met, even while being 2D she isn't that different from daily, her voice also is unmistakable, so I was surprised when I bumped into her. I loved VTubers for many years but I never imagined that she would become a somewhat famous VTuber that people would try to ruin her life, she has an attitude but she can also be quite sensitive, that's why it is very tiring and frustating to see this from the outside and not be able to do much and see all the shit she keeps eating freely because it is clear that she is a very private person and will probably never be able to talk about this issue and stand up for herself because of company issues or whatever (in case she doesnt know yet about all the shitstorm you are making) \nYou decide what to do with this. I don't think I'm posting here again anymore because I'm not into feeding drama, just wanted to make some sense of it to the people who are suffering from this \"incident\" (even if some of them don't deserve it) "
