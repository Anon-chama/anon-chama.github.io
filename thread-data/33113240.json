If anything I would say they're far worst since they have the need to spend so much of their time and money for a little bit of attention and validation from their oshi while trying to always act like good boys.\nI came to the Vtubing comunnity like many others when Misora debuted and at first I was like any other Simp until I realized the hypocrisy of it all and end up here as a way to talk about it. \nI stay because shitposting is fun and anons here always makes me laugh when reading the thread. Also, is a great way to keep track of whatever drama shit happens around Wactor. I love that shit and I won't deny it.\nPersonally I don't have an oshi but I respect the girls who properly do their job(this being creating good content or maintaining the ilusion) and so I just watch what I actually think it might be entertaining to me or put something in the background while doing other stuff when I feel like it.\nI think this is the mentality we should all have but I don't blame anons who go parasocial with some Vtuber or like the GF stuff since the parasocial bonding is where the whole Vtubing businesses model is based of and whoever trying to deny it is just delusional.\nSo let's stop pretending here, and get rid off the double standards. \nThe best way out of whatever you all were talking before is not getting a fucking girlfriend like some anon said but improving yourself as a man. \nThe girlfriend and everything else will come by her own afterwards.\nIf you want to use the girls streams as an emotional substitute that's fine too since that's part of their job and they know it, but you will grown out of it eventually.\nAnd still I wouldn't recommend since there always the possibility of a let down if the girl is not professional enough in their job or for any outside reason.
