Sadly I'm not wasting my time infiltrating any of them, bc i would also get banned. But desu if i wasn't, aside from helping the community, one of the reasons i would love to become a mod is to be aware of everything behind the scenes including bans and controversies, \nand also larp as a vigilante against schizos to infiltrate their servers, get a hand on that sweet info to satisfy my autism, and report it to maidchan or any vtuber\n "
