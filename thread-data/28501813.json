Ito and Yue speak jp combined with eng so you get used to it.\nApps like duolingo are not good for learning but they are good for practicing, as for kanji I don't know anything but I will surely print the workbooks soon.\nDepending on your interest you might understand Yome's jokes in about 2 months before someone translates them.
