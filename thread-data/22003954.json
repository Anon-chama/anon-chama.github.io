You just adopt an easily recognisable persona in the thread and start socialising. Basic human instincts are causing you anons to depersonify, you think you are different from the discord but your desire to socialize made you lose your way. You are all pathetic what is this proud anon? Miutomo op? MTF/HTF? Sereserena? You are all looking for the same thing, saying an anon did something is not the same as saying a name did something. All for the simple desire to be remembered they acquire a label to fit in. Good night.
