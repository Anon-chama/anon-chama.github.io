In a couple months she may be able to pull serious numbers if she somehow brings some Twichfaggots and a minimal portion of the Minecraft kiddies. ",

The problem with locally grown chubas is that they are mostly retarded, most of them like to get into drama and are very passive aggressive towards eachother. Out of the most \"recognizable\" ones Nimu is mostly on Twitch, Suwie is a menhera who gained a big audience because drama and lost such audience because her streams was just her bitching about \"people who will not be named\" and became really boring streams, added to the fact that she kept switching styles with the avatars which kept her from keeping the recognition. Nala threw a fit when she lost like 100 subs and cried because muh numbers, went silent, returned with the announcement that she was gonna stream on Twitch without the avatar and when her numbers only kept dwindling she changed avatar which only costed her more views and now she dropped out the edge of the internet. Other bunch are either men in female avatars, low quality vrchat avatars or girls who simply stoped their activities when they didn't get 1million subs in their first 3 months. There's also a lot of small timers on twitch, but I don't know how well they do since I don't use that site, but out of them all, Emberlith, Nekomi and Aruzeya seem to be the biggest and the ones who are doing best, with Ember even doing deals with ES anime streaming sites.\nThere's also YadiDoll who seems to be doing well too, keeping steady numbers, but I'm not into full 3D avatars so I don't follow her that much and one who only uploads once a week with 3rd world roleplay ASMRs called Mappi who is also growing at a steady pace but she doesn't do much so her growth is rather slow.
