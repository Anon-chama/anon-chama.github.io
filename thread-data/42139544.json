I was just one of many.And if I think that the reason why Himea is safe is because Nana chan has her under her protection, it shows that she has esteem for her. There is no streaming where she appears, or my imagination lends her more attention to their tweets than to the other talents. Also the image on the cover of the Discord W group is Himea. Nana chan seems to have realized that the girl is a little \"distracted\" and younger than the other talents. So we can make sure 50/50 that she's safe. I hope she doesn't allow him to renew his contract. Nana chan must keep Himea away from the gnome. ",
