When they are finally going to do it she throws you on the bed and gets on top of you, she takes your cock and puts it inside her, she starts to move hard but suddenly she lies down on your chest and stops, she fell asleep. The little Chinese girl works so hard and tried so hard to give you a special night that she didn't rest enough, you love her, you kiss her forehead and sleep next to her.\n>Rose: she is worried because she thinks you will stop loving her and go with someone else so she decides to take your first time, she takes you to her house and undresses you. in a desperate way she starts to make you a panzuri, she does it rough and fast and starts to cry telling you not to forget her and not to change her. You wipe her tears and say that won't happen, you take her to bed and ask her to take your first time, that way you will always have her in your mind and in your heart, Rose nods and takes your purity, it's something with love and lust, it's a perfect match.\n>Miu: she is experienced so she guides you kindly on your first time, she takes your hands and tells you where to touch, with her soft voice she whispers in your ear what to do and how to do it, it's not just sex, it's love. Miu jokingly scolds you because you didn't use a condom, next time she will teach you how to use it, she kisses your cheek and says \"\u00a1Buen chico!\".\n>Luna: she wants to pretend she knows more than you but everything goes wrong, she gets mad at you and starts yelling at you, you are tired of her yelling at you so you hug her and start kissing her, she hits you and pulls your hair but you don't stop, you start caressing her body and she starts to give in. She takes a totally different attitude, little moans come out of her mouth, you end up doing it and you discover a Luna that no one else will be able to see, that submissive and compliant little Luna that will only show you.\n>Ito: She's clumsy but cute, she doesn't know she's about to have sex with you. You have lied to her, you told her that what you are about to do will increase her level in Apex, she totally believed it, you grope her huge breasts at your will as well as her huge and voluptuous body, she accepts it with an awkward smile because she believes that everything is for the good of Apex, you end up taking her to bed, you feel a little guilty but finally you do it, you take Ito's virginity and she takes yours, during the whole night you do what you want with that beautiful body. The next morning you wake up, Ito is gone, scared you look for her and after a while you manage to find her. She is playing Apex, she listens to you and turns to you smiling and says proudly \"It worked, I improved a lot, thank you!\" she shows you her stats proudly and you caress her head, you are in love.\n>Hina: you finally meet her you traveled to Japan to see her, she is your favorite, she understands your language and you love her with all your heart but she reacts with disgust when sees you, all the time she looks at you with indifference until in a moment another man arrives, he is uglier and darker than you, he is a homeless junkie with no money, it is Hina who is supporting him with all the superchats you gave her. You run out of time with her and she leaves saying \"oye tu idol te est\u00e1 eng\u00f1ando hehehe\" she walks away with that man while he squeezes her big ass that you will never touch, in the distance you see how they enter a hotel, sad and depressed you decide to go hire a prostitute and so you lose your virginity.\n>Lia: you are at her house, she looks at you and tells you to undress, you do it and she observes your dick carefully \"pfff\" she says and then she lets out a huge laugh \"I won't feel anything with that\" after saying it she stands against the wall and lifts her skirt \"do me from behind\" you approach her with nerves and fear, she grabs your arm and pulls you towards her, she wiggles her ass on your crotch and makes your cock stand up, she takes it hard and puts it in her anus, fuck it is the most pleasurable thing you have ever felt, she starts to move her ass in a soft way, she knows what she is doing, you can't handle the pleasure and you cum, she laughs but doesn't stop, your cock gets hard again and finally you get it right.
