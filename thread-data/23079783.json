Why don't you say the same about your managers and translators group or aren't they fans? Are they your friends? Why can they send things and write to you privately?\n>The narrative that akira supervises those chats is a fallacy because if akira supervises those chats the same way he sends emails to laila well he better not supervise anything. I think they should delete the discord but they should also delete all the groups with useless translators, what do they translate? they haven't translated anything for a long time, they just took advantage of you and you gave them the opportunity. For now things are getting interesting in the discord and the information I have from the 4th gen I still think it will happen, be careful and don't soften your heart with a fake girl with a mental illness confirmed by herself.\n>Fake fake fake fake you only care about yourself, you only give priority to yourself, you don't think about anyone else's opinion other than those who agree with your stupid point of view, you won't learn anything and the moment you become indie you will fail like every other thing you had done in your life before joining wactor. \nOne of my favorite posts of hers, very good, please read it.

I would assume you were doing something malicious, something you thought might be in your future (especially from a male mod, no less). I have no idea. Either way, that's the reality. How do they do it with girls? I wouldn't bother to make that up. It's one of the few things that they try. They just can't be trusted and they end up making their way to their final destination. I had the following: First the mod would look like the most malicious, and then the next woman would be like \"fuck her\", 'cause you're going to have another girl to go with you. I was in charge of girls, and the first girl to join them was a fucking idiot. Also the next girl would be fucking insane. I'm not talking about some stupid mod, you know. I'm talking about someone who is very much willing to be a dick to people. It's extremely difficult, they have tons of problems. The next girl in the group was like \"holy fuck\" because they were already on a list\n "
