        "content": " I RESIGN FROM SEDAI ONE.\nI see that many people are eager for the gossip, but there's not much to discuss there.\nI have always been clear and transparent about the things that are done in Sedai One, and this won't be an exception.\nTo get straight to the point, this has been brewing for a few days and I was hoping to make it public at the beginning of October. But due to external factors, I'm advancing the official announcement.\nAs of September 13th, I no longer belong to the internal administration of Sedai One.\nThe official reasons behind this are an accumulation of disagreements with the person behind Sedai One, the CEO, regarding resource management, talent management, and processes within the company.\nThe unofficial/personal reasons are that I can no longer compensate for the lack of staff with my work, I can't be attentive to everyone, nor can I continue to endure certain bureaucratic processes that hinder the completion of projects.\nI've spent two years managing talents and have witnessed certain situations in the process of each project that prevented them from being executed correctly, such as lack of budget, communication issues, language barriers, among others.\nOriginally, I took charge of Endou Lily and was able to oversee her project throughout its process as much as possible. Later, I decided to take on all the talents to try and give a group direction to the content. Multiple consequences of mismanagement not of my doing prevented this.\nI did much more than I should have. From staff searching to their preparation. It was a search for a healthy staff and to create a good environment for the talents. This resulted in few people as almost no one met the profile.\nPerhaps I was inflexible in the search, which is why there was always a lack of personnel. But it wasn't my job to do it, and finding people with good morals and talent is genuinely very challenging. But most people were capable of providing a good place for them.\nAt least under my supervision, I made sure they were safe and their voices were heard to the extent that I could negotiate as an intermediary. In general, it IS an environment where they have a lot of freedom and there's concern for their well-being.\nClarifying those points, my departure is for health and freedom reasons. I'm taking off \"la camiseta\" to no longer carry that weight. All of this greatly affected my overall health, I had many relapses and took anxiety medication in recent months.\nI made sure to leave people prepared to continue the projects and offered Sedai One external consultancy. Emphasizing that this will only be at the manager and talent level. If any of the girls need help, my DMs are open.\nTo conclude and not give room for idle gossip:\n-The issue is with the agency's CEO.\n-It's not their fault.\n-I left people prepared.\n-If you need my external help, I'm here.\n-I no longer have contracts with the agency;\n-So, I'm free to speak about many things.\nThank you for reading.\nPlease continue to support the girls and don't pressure them in their livestreams.\nI will still hang around in the livestreams and server; I just don't have to deal with many things anymore.\nI'm also keeping an eye on Aimi's graduation process.
