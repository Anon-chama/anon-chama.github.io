My bet is that the girl in question (we don't really know who she is but it is suspected to be Rakkun) confronted her privately and now she doesn't want to stream for fear of Rakkun's fans shitting on her in the chat or maybe even Rakkun showing up there.\nAs for Zilverk, I hate that double faced piece of shit.
