(Lawsuit begins in paraguay takes effect in japan)\nBut Akira's contract says!!!! \n-it doesn't matter they 'can sue him for trying to enforce the 5million fine'. \n-If the contract was in Japan the fight takes place in the Japanese court which will not give Akira the right.\n-Can the girls win? \nThe girls will win \n-Rose and Hana too?\nyes because Akira's contract will not be upheld by any japanese court but it will take time but they will be free from the fine completely and probably receive compensation\n-How are they going to pay all the lawyers? Akira is going to pay them EVERYTHING EVERYTHING EVERYTHING there are already vtubers who won but it took them 1-2 years\n-It is unlikely that Gustavo's lawsuit will move forward but it may help to put pressure on the company.\n-What if Akira files for bankruptcy? It doesn't matter, he'll have to pay with his ass if necessary. \n-Does this affect the girls inside?\nNo, the lawsuit is against Akira, it doesn't touch the others. \nin short a lawsuit for doxxing them, a lawsuit for trying to fine them, a lawsuit if they actually withhold the money.
