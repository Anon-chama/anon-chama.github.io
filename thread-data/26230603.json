It is important to rationalize why you think what you think and why you like what you like.\nYou need to remember in what kind of community you are in, this is just a branch of the anime community... \nand being honest, this is not where the most manly and thoughtful people gather together in. Most people you see out there with the same argument of \"Ellas pueden hacer lo que quieran, mientras ellas sean felices yo estoy bien\" and all its variants, are a bunch of weak Yes Men who \nmostly lacks an own opinion and will go with whatever is more safe and popular for the sake of looking good to others even if they don't feel comfortable with it. And more when they see there is no people in the other side, that's how they work. This is not a weird think, this is normal psychological reaction present in all parts of society. \nSo if they see your arguments they might even put some thought into it and realize something new.
