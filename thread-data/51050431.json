        "content": " So I had a couple of busy weeks lately and I couldn't get much done with Shura's Moto Adventures. In fact I was so busy I missed Shura's reveal and Anya's debut. More than that, I've hit a roadblock of sorts because I'm not quite satisfied with the parameters I've chosen for the simulation (previous update \nhttps://files.catbox.moe/iai0ih.mp4\n ) . It's kind of hard to get things the way I want them to work. There are lots of different parameters to choose from like friction, mass, density, restitution, etc and all of these parameters for each part of the bike. I might end up making some sort of editor where you can choose all of these parameters to try to fine tune it.\nFor now I was working on a level editor which will be needed later: \nhttps://files.catbox.moe/8u6vma.mp4\n "
