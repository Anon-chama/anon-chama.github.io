While I still think that something else more serious has to have happened for Maid-chan to dox her, i bet every anon can agree that its at least understandable for an outsider to doubt the company, as he could have kicked her and just that, so fair point. \nHowever, if you don't do that, it think you'll be alright with the power of Yuan \nand hopefully gringo USD power\n by your side. To be honest, I'd be more worried about two things. First, permissions. It seems Maid cant get Game permissions easily for some reason. I believe Luna mentioned something about \"getting permissions from all countries\" being hard, and that the Torero cover was delayed a lot because of permissions, so its because of that or unefficient management. So if you are a gamer, it can be tough to show off. But if you are talkative, ESLs will watch le charla libre for hours, and if you are creative or play indie games, the there you have come content suitable for everyone. Second would be not pandering too much to spics, because as painful as it can be, English and Japanese speakers don't like Spanish dominating the chat \nor maybe its just that they hate obnoxious behaviour or people spamming \u00d1 because they can't overcome the fact that they cant speak english\n. Sorry I type too much. I'll see you in the auditions if I make it lol\n>>24354684\nThat's cute. Just hope she doesn't think its just your plan to approach to her again and not a genuine apology, which I hope it is tbqh "

It was in a lonely friday when he decided to give the media to the wrong person... Maybe he just got bored of everything and wanted some new entertainment meanwhile he was departing from this place. \"I want to change the world\", an easy task if you're willing to self destruct in the process tof destroying someone else... But I guess it doesn't matter to you anymore.\nLet me tell you that I was a witness of the moment. That moment that your urge for being relevant for a few days surpassed your principles... Now let's watch together as this world crumbles and everything you once loved starts to disappear. It may be the last time you're going to feel regret in this life... "
