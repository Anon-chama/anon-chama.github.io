If the chuuba is single your genes tells you this is desirable and it will make you happy. That's it.\nYour enjoyment of watching anything is bound by you neurological makeup, and no matter how you try to reason with yourself that it still supposed to be \"fun\" even if she has a boyfriend, your brain just won't agree with you. The cope of \"I will never fuck her anyway\" just won't fool people with above average IQ and normally developed brains.\nThe chuuba could still retain an audience but who in their right fucking mind would still be a whale who gives huge amounts of money to some girl who has a bf who obviously enjoys her body regularly and not only that but he enjoys your fan given money too? \nAnd let me tell you a secret, they fucking know all this shit, if you think they not you're just delusional.\nIn other words, depending on the approach this could be a very mean way of manipulation. Making a living in the expense of men loneliness is arguably already inmoral but the bf thing is going an step beyond. \nBut again it depends on the approach, sometimes just the fact of hiding a relationship is enough for people to make their own ilusions. And they also know this shit.\nThe best approach is being upfront about it even if this cost you the big easy money this ilusion could bring you but compensate with quality and creative content so the people not just stay for the content creator but for the content itself. This is going to mean hard work but it will be earnest and honest money and support from your fanbase. "

If you have an emotional need you are going to find this type of content appealing. After all whether you use it as a girlfriend simulator like we do with Vtubers or as friend simulator as many does with irl streamers. Both are the same.\nThe difference in which of thosis more morally acceptable lies on things that I had already mentioned.\nHow to know you're parasocial? People who casually watch don't donate or buy merchandise so if you SC frequently or buy merchandise is very likely you're in some kind of parasocial relationship. "
