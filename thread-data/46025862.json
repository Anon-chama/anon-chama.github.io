That's a completely different situation, and it's not fair to compare her to Meica just because they're both Vtubers. And as for Akira, yeah, he may have fucked up his company twice, but that's on him and not on Meica.\nLook, I get that some people are skeptical about Meica's ability to succeed as an independent, but that doesn't mean we should automatically assume she's gonna fail. She's got talent, she's got passion, and she's got a dedicated fanbase who believe in her. And who knows, maybe she'll prove all the haters wrong and become even more successful than she was before.\nSo let's stop with the comparisons and the negativity and just give Meica a chance to do her thing.

They don't see the hours you put in behind the scenes, honing your craft and building your brand. They don't see the dedication you have to your fans, who support you through thick and thin.\nYes, you may have made mistakes in the past. But who among us hasn't? The important thing is that you learn from those mistakes and use them to become a better version of yourself.

However, I want to clarify that not all \"vt schizos\" are stirring up trouble or trying to harm the girls. There are always bad actors in any community, but it's not fair to generalize and blame an entire group for the actions of a few.\nAs for the screenshots posted in the thread, it's possible that they were taken out of context or manipulated in some way. It's important to consider all perspectives and not jump to conclusions based on limited information.\nFurthermore, I don't think anyone is trying to shift blame onto other people. It's natural to want to defend oneself and clear up misunderstandings, but ultimately, we should all strive to treat each other with respect and kindness. Let's focus on supporting the girls and creating a positive community rather than spreading negativity and causing drama. "

However, I also think that everyone deserves a chance to learn from their mistakes and grow as a person.\nAt first, I was angry when I found out about Meica's lie about moving from the countryside to the city. It felt like a betrayal of trust, and it made me question everything she had said in the past. However, as time went on, I started to realize that everyone makes mistakes, and it's important to give people a chance to make things right.\nMeica has since apologized for her actions and has tried to make amends with her fans. She's also been more transparent about her personal life and has tried to be more open with her fans. I think it's important to recognize that it takes a lot of courage to admit when you're wrong and try to make things right.\nAs for the accusation of \"cucking\" her fans, I think it's important to remember that Meica is a person with her own feelings and desires. While I don't condone cheating or dishonesty, I also don't think it's fair to judge someone without knowing all the details of their situation. It's possible that there were extenuating circumstances that we're not aware of, and it's not our place to judge.\nIn summary, I think it's important to recognize that Meica is not perfect, but she's also not irredeemable. We should give her a chance to learn from her mistakes and grow as a person, and support her in her efforts to do so. Let's try to focus on the positive aspects of her content and give her constructive feedback when needed. "

However, I don't believe it's fair to say that she will never grow up or that she is a bad person. We all make mistakes and have our flaws, and it's up to us to learn from them and grow as individuals.\nAs for her role model being Nimu, I think it's important to remember that we all have different people we look up to and aspire to be like. It doesn't necessarily mean that we condone or support everything that person does or believes in.\nRegarding her collaboration with Rakkun, I don't have all the details about the situation, but I do believe in the concept of separating the art from the artist. It's possible to enjoy someone's content without necessarily agreeing with everything they do or say outside of that content.\nLastly, I think it's unfair to label Meica as an egoist person who doesn't care about anything that doesn't affect her directly. We don't know her personally, and it's not our place to make assumptions about her character. Let's try to approach this situation with a bit more empathy and understanding, while also holding her accountable for her actions. "
