I wanted an umbrella term to discuss all the girls I wanted to discuss, namely Hina, Luna, Neon, Sezia and Himea without resorting to some sort of /spic/ or /\u00f1/ general, since that would undoubtedly invite discussion of other companies and indies like Sedai, Amai, and even things like Nimu which I'm not interested in. /wactor/ satisfies all of these requirements with ease.\nAnd although I was initially adamant that the split shouldn't have been made, now I urge you to stay in your containment thread since now it is obvious that, one: the shitter comes from your thread as evidenced by yesterday's blunder where he mistakenly posted his bait in the other thread first, and two: both the imagespammer and the choripaschizo are both hardcore misopitas and now that your containment thread exists, we no longer have to deal with that shit.\nI am fine with a smaller and slower general, I don't care if it doesn't survive the night.
