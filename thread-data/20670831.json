If it is true that she left discord out of protest for her boyfriends? or was it because of the harassment of Faka and her shitty friends? I know that she spoke out at that and had explained that they sent her DM and things like that and that's why she left Discord, but when I saw the video of her return it seemed that it was more because of differences with Akira and anger when attacking her circle of incels, but I really do not know, this place confuses my mind, Mind, please someone who knows the truth, clarify all this, at least I want to know that he is no longer in the clutches of those idiots and at least he is with the girls like Miu and Luna and only uses discord like them. I repeat the little group mental parasites that if I believe it totally, misora is very stupid hidden that, it is almost as if I wanted to say it to everyone and that everyone accepted that I finally got friends who are looking for a way to idiotize her more to have sex for discord and take out her tits, like an image that I saw and I paralyze myself from disgust and fear.
