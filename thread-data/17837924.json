Why don't you say the same about your managers and translators group or aren't they fans? Are they your friends? Why can they send things and write to you privately? \nThe narrative that akira supervises those chats is a fallacy because if akira supervises those chats the same way he sends emails to laila well he better not supervise anything. I think they should delete the discord but they should also delete all the groups with useless translators, what do they translate? they haven't translated anything for a long time, they just took advantage of you and you gave them the opportunity. For now things are getting interesting in the discord and the information I have from the 4th gen I still think it will happen, be careful and don't soften your heart with a fake girl with a mental illness confirmed by herself. \nFake fake fake fake you only care about yourself, you only give priority to yourself, you don't think about anyone else's opinion other than those who agree with your stupid point of view, you won't learn anything and the moment you become indie you will fail like every other thing you had done in your life before joining wactor.
