In japan there is this thing called 'scandals' where idol's life can get ruined because some photographer saw her with a guy in a restaurant. If you 'hate' that it's because you think a person can be free to have a relationship openly, therefore, you, in the same position of an idol, can only rebel yourself against this idol culture by doing the opposite of what the traditional idols do, that is, having no problems in showing your boyfriend to your public. \nIf you do not do that then you are just a hypocrite.
