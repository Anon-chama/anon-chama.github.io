They had a battle for several years as every time she got caught and reported, she would go back to making new profiles kek \nAnd I guess that's the content they found as at a certain point Luna gave up and just started ignoring her. Luna had an ask account where she would reply to followers about live info and stuff about when she sang at anime cons, but she ended up deleting it. I don't really know what kind of evidence are you expecting since this was around 10 years ago and it's not like I've been saving screenshots all my life for this particular case. "
