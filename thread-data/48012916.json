Anonymous imageboards are, by their very nature, open and vulnerable to raids from shitters and tourists. But there is a moderation team, however flawed, than can at least partially deal with this issue if you do your part in reporting and ignoring the retards. \nWhen the split initially happened, we were reluctant to change the name of the thread because it would only lead to fights over what girl was allowed to be discussed in what thread. And remember that we do not want to broaden the scope of this thread to include other Spanish speaking vtubers, we're not interested in Sedai, Amai or whatever 1view indie you want to shill here. We wanted to discuss the wactor girls that had been graduated and the ones still in the company, and the /wactor/ umbrella could easily fit all of that.\nI'm against changing the name of the general because honestly, at this point what good is it going to do? Do you really believe shitters are unable to open the catalogue and ctrl+f for \"Meica\" or \"Nisha\"? We're talking about 4chan, the most famous imageboard in the world.
