But on the other hand, I feel like I have to work harder and put myself in too deep, and the number of situations where I fall into physical discomfort and mental instability has increased.\n I have been thinking that since I am a corporate officer, I have to take responsibility for every task, including the management of my health, and I have been working hard for these tasks. However, the stress is so great that it has an impact on my body and mind, and it is likely that this will continue to hinder my work. Therefore, after careful consideration, I decided to graduate at the same time as the end of my contract.\n During this year, I have made many connections with fans and friends, and have had many valuable experiences such as releasing original songs and disclosing 3D models. This was also thanks to the full support of everyone. Although it is very painful for me to betray all of you who are looking forward to my second year of activities, it is a judgment that I have made after careful discussion with the management, and I would be grateful if I could get your understanding.\n Since I graduated for this reason, I haven't thought about what I want to do after graduation. I would be grateful if you would not ask me and other members about this. \n Lastly, I would like to thank the artist who designed the image of Hoshina Suzu, Mr. Muriritaro, the creators, all the Vtubers who worked with me, and all the people who supported me.\nI have a lot of plans to enjoy with you before the event ends, so please walk with me with a smile on your face!\n I will do my best for the rest of the event, so please take care of me. Thank you!\nMay 9, 2022\nHoshina Bell Author: Hoshina Bell - Official WACTOR \nhttps://www.bilibili.com/read/cv16515249\n Source: bilibili\nTranslated with \nwww.DeepL.com/Translator\n (free version) "
