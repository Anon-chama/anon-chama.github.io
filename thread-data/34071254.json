But I had to work with whatever information Twitter does make available.\nGiven around 3250 tweets, which span from April 29th to the present day, September 26th, I made a histogram. I made sure to separate tweets based on \"before and after August 28th\" criteria, which was the day Hina tweeted she had her last meal in her old house. I was hoping to find a discrepancy in the activity before and after that date but there really wasn't any. Still, it is hard to infer a lot from this very limited amount of information, but I had to try. ",
