        "content": " In a membership stream Lunita read this copypasta, it reminds me of the treacherous moderators\n>Onions un moderador de Discord a tiempo completo y en este momento estoy administrando 10 servidores a la vez. Disfruto de mi trabajo, disfruto interactuar con diferentes comunidades, y es bueno que la gente me reconozca en todos los chats. Sin embargo, recientemente mi madre ha estado rega\u00f1andome porque quiere que consiga un trabajo a pesar de que ya tengo uno como moderador de Discord a tiempo completo.\n>Hace un par de semanas me encontraba cenando con familiares, y todos estaban discutiendo sobre sus respectivas carreras y empleos. Mi primo es bombero, y estaba hablando de lo f\u00edsicamente agotador que era el subir escaleras y manejar el equipo contra incendios. Mi t\u00edo trabaja en finanzas, y se quejaba de lo dificil que era tener que lidiar con su jefe y el conseguir un ascenso. Mi prima (Quien se encuentra estudiando) comenzo a hablar de lo agotador que era el tener que estudiar desde que comenz\u00f3 su nuevo semestre en la universidad. Fue aqu\u00ed cuando, sintiendome orgulloso de mi mismo y mi trabajo, anuncie y confes\u00e9 que mi trabajo tambien era bastante duro y agotador, y que era tan agotador que mis dedos se cansaban muy a menudo y ten\u00eda que hacer estiramientos especiales para que no se me saliera el t\u00fanel carpiano. Hubo un silencio bastante incomodo hasta que escuch\u00e9 a mi hermano soltar una peque\u00f1a carcajada y todos rompieron en risa. Pod\u00eda sentir la mirada de enojo y verg\u00fcenza de mi padre desde el otro lado de la mesa, y estuve un par de minutos all\u00ed hasta que termine mi comida y simplemente volv\u00ed a mi habitaci\u00f3n, en donde le cont\u00e9 lo que acababa de pasar a uno de mis gatitos.\n>Pasaron algunas semanas, y estaba en medio de una capacitaci\u00f3n para convertirme en moderador de otro servidor cuando de pronto, mi madre abre la puerta y me pide hablar conmigo. Yo simplemente suspir\u00e9 e intent\u00e9 ignorarla, pero le preste atenci\u00f3n en cuanto note una mirada de tristeza en su rostro. \"Cari\u00f1o, tu padre y yo te echaremos en 2 semanas si no consigues un trabajo\", me dijo mientras que incontables l\u00e1grimas emanaban de sus ojos. Yo, un poco tocado con la situaci\u00f3n, le asegure que no ten\u00eda por que preocuparse ya que este era mi trabajo y me gustaba bastante. Ante eso, ella se qued\u00f3 perpleja, y luego me pregunt\u00f3: \"\u00bfGanas algo de dinero con eso?\" Yo, un poco desconcertado y confundido por la pregunta, le respond\u00ed que uno de los due\u00f1os de uno de los servidores me compraba un mes de nitro en caso de que ocurriera un raid. Ella me confes\u00f3 que no entend\u00eda que era nitro ni que era un raid, y me explic\u00f3 que preferir\u00eda que tuviera un trabajo real porque mi padre ya estaba cansado de tener que lidiar conmigo.\n>Tengo 28 a\u00f1os, este es mi sue\u00f1o y mi pasi\u00f3n, estoy en medio de completar mi entrenamiento y finalmente obtener mi certificado de administrador en uno de mis servidores m\u00e1s deseados. No quiero ni imaginar lo que har\u00edan mis gatitos sin m\u00ed sino puedo usar discord en mi PC. \u00a1No quiero imaginar lo que pasar\u00eda con esos servidores luego de mi partida! \u00bfQu\u00e9 debo hacer? \u00bfAlg\u00fan consejo? >\u00a1Por favor ay\u00fadenme!\n "
