I don't hate Misora at all, I just think that there are so many girls who are willing to entertain us despite the language barrier that they deserve their place here. ",

I don't see anything wrong with that at all, and if you feel like Misora is threatened by this small change, please go outside and reflect on your mental health\nPlus it's free advertising, which is good even with all the shitposting.
