Also I don't think after so many days she wouldn't be aware of the twitter account, if it wasn't hers she would have already posted a message like \"chicos esta es mi \u00fanica cuenta\" on instagram or something like that.

Luna and Neon might come back after their suspension, though, and they will be forced to pretend nothing happened.\nI was hoping that fans as a whole could pressure Akira to allow the girls to renegotiate their contracts but two things happened, Hina showed up on her other account and that made a lot of people let a sigh of relief, forgetting the rest of the girls that are still trapped under a shitty contract. And two, that Sonic autist redirected outrage to Lia, also making people forget the actual problem at hand.\nAs it stands right now, what's more likely to happen is that the girls are going to return from their suspension and will be forced to pretend nothing happened until their contract expires, which could mean almost two years for Neon and Sezia.

Niji, that Idol corp or whatever it's called, maybe PC I don't know much about other agencies. If anyone in Japan is paying attention, they'd know wactor is collapsing, or at least their ES branch and it would make sense to capitalize on the opportunity to pull in numbers from the spic audience.
