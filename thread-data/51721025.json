Shura's Motoadventures is very close to completion, there are two things I need to do. The code is all over the place and a fucking mess so I need to bring it all together in a cohesive way. And I also need to make levels for it, I even made a level editor which I will include with the game so anyone can make levels if they have the patience to deal with my crude editor. ",
