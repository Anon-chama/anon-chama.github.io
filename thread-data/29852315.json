Mood swings which can include feelings of intense distress and possibly thoughts of suicide.\n>Feeling alone and difficulty in having healthy relationships \u2013 because children who experienced sexual abuse are often left feeling let down or \u2018betrayed\u2019 by people that they trusted \u2013 as adults they can often find it very difficult to trust other people. They can fear getting hurt or rejected \u2013 and either isolate themselves from other people, or, become too clingy or over dependent. Some people expect to be \u2018let down\u2019 which can mean they\u2019re more likely to be pulled into difficult or abusive relationships.\n>Feelings of shame and guilt \u2013 a child who experienced sexual abuse is likely to have been manipulated or forced into keeping the abuse a secret \u2013 the abuser may even have tried to blame them for the abuse. As a result, feelings of shame, guilt and \u2018being to blame\u2019 for not stopping the abuse from happening, can become a central part of their self-image. >This can especially happen if other people such as family members failed to protect the child from the abuse or reacted with shock or horror when told about what happened. Such feelings of shame can affect self-esteem \u2013 adult survivors can feel \u2018useless\u2019, \u2018different\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019, \u2018dirty\u2019, \u2018not good enough\u2019 or \u2018worthless\u2019 and these can become core self-beliefs. Survivors can also be overly self-critical, expecting too much of themselves known as \u2018perfectionism\u2019 or may not expect anything at all. \n>Feeling powerless \u2013 finding it hard to say \u2018no\u2019 when necessary or asserting your own needs. Some survivors can react in other ways \u2013 by behaving aggressively, trying to control other people or by developing an eating disorder \u2013 all as a means of taking back some control. \n>Sexual difficulties including problems with physical contact and intimacy. Sexual contact can become connected in a child\u2019s mind with feelings of fear, shame and helplessness.\n>Anxiety \u2013 experiencing trauma can make adult survivors more aware and fearful about possible danger. It can be common to feel anxious and fearful about bad things happening. Some survivors can experience hypervigilance \u2013 a state of feeling constantly \u2018on guard\u2019 and looking for potential threats, phobias and panic attacks.\n>Nightmares and \u2018Flashbacks\u2019 which are very powerful memories of what happened feel very real and can be very distressing. A survivor may feel like the traumatic event is taking place again and may even be able to smell scents, hear sounds or feel pain that they experienced at the time. When someone experiences a distressing and traumatic experience the mechanism for sorting and storing memories can become overwhelmed and the mind is not able to process the experience, in the usual way. This means that the memory is still active and can be very easily triggered by anything that is a reminder of what happened \u2013 this could be a place, person, smell or sound. Survivors can also \u2018relive\u2019 what happened to them through distressing nightmares or might dream about being trapped or chased by their abuser.\n>Dissociation \u2013 a feeling similar to that of \u2018day-dreaming\u2019 when you feel lost in your own thoughts and disconnected from what\u2019s going on around you. The experience, however, can be more complete for survivors of child sexual abuse who may have no memory of a period of time. They may feel as if they\u2019re outside of their body or may even adopt a different identity while experiencing dissociation. Dissociation may be triggered by something that reminded the person of the traumatic event. It\u2019s an automatic response acting like a fuse which is there to protect you from an electric shock during a power surge. It can become problematic, however, if it starts to happen too often. \n>Memory problems \u2013 some people may only remember small fragments of what happened or may not be able to recall whole periods of their childhood. They may have buried the memories deep down until a time when they may be more ready to cope with them. Sometimes memories or flashbacks can start to surface later in life \u2013 or, in some cases, may never emerge. Like dissociation, memory loss is a natural defence mechanism which developed to help us protect ourselves from recalling distressing and overwhelming experiences. \n>Long-term Psychological Effects Of Sexual Abuse\n>Depression\n>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n>Anxiety\n>Low self-esteem or self-image\n>Cognitive impairment\n>Eating disorders\n>Increased risk of substance abuse\n>Increased risk of unsafe sexual behaviors\n>Increased risk of self-harm\n>Increased risk of suicide\n>Relationship problems (including intimacy issues in future relationships)\n "
