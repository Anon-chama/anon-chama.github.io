In a way I get it, spics are less likely to donate, to buy memberships or to buy merchandise but I still think we're being treated unfairly here. Hana often tries to paint the spic community as being particularly vile or toxic but remember that Japs and Chinks like to end girls' careers because they mentioned a country or because they were caught talking to a male on discord. The English speaking community will harass you and send you death threats for playing a wizards game for kids and spics... spics make takataka jokes I guess.\nAs much hate Meica gets here for \"trying too hard to be a latina\", I feel like she's the only one who genuinely cares for the spic audience and loves the spic style shitposting.
