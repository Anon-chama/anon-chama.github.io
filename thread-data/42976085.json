I can give him the benefit of the doubt and believe he thought the girls would return. Back when it was unclear if Meica account was really Hina or not. But after confirming it was indeed Hina, how could you possibly reconcile this fact with Akira trying to enforce the narrative that the girls are only taking a break? And after today how can he still side with Akira? Is being \"a mod\" for some shit company so important to him? What is this guy's problem? "
