There were rumors about her relationship with the maid and that she was bullying Clary Rose.\nAccording to her, she called her abusive words towards her a misunderstanding, and maybe she still felt uncomfortable, and she told me that Rose had something to say. I was asked if there was\nShe replied that she didn't because I hadn't spoken to her other than her request for translation.\nAnd he asked me if I thought the rumor was true. I asked if she felt like she was bullying Rose or if she was being favored by her administration.\nAfter that, she told me that she contacted me because she thought that if I talked to her maid, she would release Rose's personal information.\nAt that time, I believed the story and thought that he was only talking to me, but the truth was different.\nLater, I was told in a DM that she had told other people the same story, which made me wonder. Because this was a clear violation of the rules by Mr. Ria.\nI then suggested that we talk to Melun so that we could work things out together, and went to talk. The reply I received from Melun was that if Leah wanted to talk to her, she should contact her directly, not through me, a fan of hers.\nAlso, Melun has no intention of discussing with Lia, and rumors are spreading by contacting her fans.\nShe replied that it was threatening to tell the maid that she was going to release her personal information. \"I don't understand why my personal information is being made public due to rumors circulating among fans,\" he said.\nThis incident made me suspicious of Leah, and to be honest, it seemed like I was making Melun take responsibility for the rumors spread by her fans.\nHowever, Leah was talking about her non-disclosure agreement during the broadcast, and what she did was found to be a violation of this agreement (I had an internal discussion with Rose when she was at the company earlier. I have been told that I was doing it).\nAgain, this conversation took place in the translation group server managed by the maid, and the management could confirm the content of the conversation at any time.\nWhy did you try to protect yourself from rumors until you broke the contract you agreed to?\nWhy did the maid allow this act without doing anything or saying anything?\nNow member Hizuki Miu is being blamed in the same way, and there are a lot of rumors going around.\nWhy can't she say the same? Is it because you don't want to?\nSince Ria no longer belongs to the company, she cannot be protected by the company either.\nMy work as a translator was voluntary. I have not agreed to the contract, nor have I promised not to publish this story. I have no reason to hide it anymore, so I decided to speak here now. "

After Meica resurfaced, all he had to do was 1) rebrand and 2) wait a year or so for things to calm down and then continue looking for talent. Instead he chose to doxx Meica, completely destroying his reputation and any chance he had in regaining the trust of the spic market.\nBut even after that, I didn't think it was possible for him to do something even dumber and yet yesterday's stream happened. He used Himea to paint the graduated girls in a bad light but there were two possible scenarios. If people believed Himea was being sincere, then the fans would turn on her and Akira would lose his biggest earner right now. Or, people would see through the ruse and only get angrier at him. There was no good possible outcome from this.\nI now understand what Laila meant with her \"I can't predict this man\". As for what he can do. He will doxx and issue empty threats, nothing more. If he doxxes Nisha I hope he gets buttfucked by European data protection laws. "
