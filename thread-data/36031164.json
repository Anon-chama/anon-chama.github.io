Mental illnesses are more frequent in women so having a daughter with Sopa or Lia is not a good idea, although Lia's would be beautiful. "

And more with what is happening with La+ and her agency...\nI do worry about her getting too close to Himea since I know how bad influences coming from \"friends\" can affect the other party and more when it comes to women.\nUnfortunately Akami is on a weird position where is hard not to look extremely fucking sus. Her track record doesn't speak good of her either. So I only hope that Himea keeps this into account by not rejecting her friendship but be wise enough to remain vigilant of posibles double intentions.\nIn the end, if Himea does not want to remain on Wactor but still want to be a Vtuber she should know that she would be better off as an indie rather than joining an agency. And if somebody wants her as a talent they should be profesional and approach her with a reeeeally good deal and not with the argument of \"because we are friends\" after all, a real friendship would support her either way, right?.\nI could say more but I won't for now, I'm only going to keep watching.
