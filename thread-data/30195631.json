Not to mention the stupid jokes about the voice packs. \nAnd she even tried to change the subject but she couldn't. The best possible approach was to end stream to show that she is not playing around or people is just gonna keep going. Because yes, the ones withe the problem were new people, Luna knows her chat pretty well. She even mentioned this.\nLook, Luna is the kind of streamer that reads most comments, its understandable that she gets annoyed by this. If you don't know this is because you probably don't watch her that much. \nIf you want a chat where you can say whatever stupid shit you want and get ignored you should go with puliglota. \n>She was always saying that people should stop saying she gets angry beacause she can hadle banter and blah blah\nI may give this to you in some extent. She did say that but again what she said was related about people saying that she always gets angry which is clearly not the case, most of the time she acts normally. Go figure. \nI get what you saying, she may have a shorter wick than others but I think that's part of her charm. She is very honest and expressive about the things she doesn't like and that's a way to know her better. That's the Luna experience for you. "
