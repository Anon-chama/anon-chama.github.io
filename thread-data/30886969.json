They make, edit and upload their short videos, maintain interaction with fans and have hinted that they talk to more vtubers outside of the public eye to maintain relationships. Besides that it seems that they have meetings once a week to discuss ideas or issues here it seems that it was where Akira tried to ask Misora in a serious tone what she was doing to gain followers but Hina being Hina replied that she was just being herself (this part was where the other chubbas outside of wactor copied the Hina livery talk) Nowadays I guess this is where those talks with Nana chan came from. Lia, Miu and lately Himari seem to be some kind of wactor ambassadors participating in all kinds of events or collaborations and we also know that Lia and Miu helped Akira to review the auditions. "

Your body is telling me how much you love this. And you love that the est\u00fapidos are thinking about us doing this\" Luna teases the catgirl, sliding her fingers in and out of her, using her thumb to tease the girl's clit.\n>\"AH! TH-THAT'S NOT! NNNGH!\" Suzu squirms in Luna's grasp, but there's no use, Suzu's body is burning like an inferno, Luna is poking all the right spots for her to go absolutely wild.\n>\"NEGH! L-LUNA-CHAN STOP! P-PLEASE! OTHERWISE I'LL-\"\n>Luna curves her fingers pressing right onto Suzu's G-spot. Suzu's back arches upward letting out a shriek\n>\"Heh, you'll what? you have to be clear~\" Luna teases more, teasing her g-spot just a little more\n>\"I-I-I'LL CUUUUUUUUUUUUUM~\" Suzu, completely red in the face lets out a cry. her body stiffens and tenses up as her pussy squirts her juices, making a mess of her own panties as well as Luna's hand.\n>Luna brings her sticky hand up to her face and licks the juices off. Suzu plops back down onto the bed, her body twitching\n>\"heeee~ wow you liked that more than I thought. we should do this again sometime~\" She taunts before leaning into Suzu, placing another pasionate kiss on the catgirl's lips.\n>Luna gets up and slowly walks outside of Suzu's room.\n>Suzu's face still burns bright red, feeling completely embarrassed that Luna could find her sensitive spots so easily...and from the sounds of it, she wants to do it all again...\n ",
