You have to stop thinking of 4chan as \"le ebil hackers\" expecting some Anons from the thread to hack their mainframe and steal their RAM.

And why has there been no announcement?\n> Where is Luna? Is she suspended and why?\n> Where is Neon? She's absent as well with no explanation. Is she suspended and why?\nIf you're watching a stream and you see Meido or Nana, ask for information about the girls. If you have some bucks to spare, you might want to consider sending a superchat just for visibility. (The cheapest one because fuck Meido). Do not say something abusive to the streamer girls.\nIf you are part of a group like a Discord server, a Facebook group, etc, explain why you think the girls aren't \"taking a break\" but are instead suspended, and suggest they should demand answers from Meido. Do not share account names of the girls if you know them.\nIn all of this, do not say something abusive to any of the girls. Do not send threats. Act like an angry customer and not like a rabid dog, and management might listen. "
