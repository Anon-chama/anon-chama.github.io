The official reason is unclear, Laila had the right to complain and fight back to terminate the contract. But here\u2019s the gist, it would compromise her plans. The scandal would reach Nijisanji management ears and close their doors. She wants, or wanted, to avoid this so she became aggressive behind scenes and now she\u2019s quite fed up, that why she revealed her claws. \nFor the other girls\u2019 perspective this was definitely unfair, since she wanted to prosper in her career but Akira denied it. From his point of view, he wants to convey a message. Wactor is not a pair of shoes, getting better prospect and moving on is nice but mind the pacing. She was practically networking from the start to leave, and he does not tolerate that. \nHana and Rose were too supportive, they can come back but their mental state is not strong enough to overcome their friend emotional pressure.

Laila wanted to break the contract early, so she could make more money. Akira, wanted to keep her channel as long as possible, to keep recieving money\nThen, instead of resolving this trouble like grown up adults, they started a shitstrom that made both of them, lose a shit ton of money. This is a case of two greedy motherfuckers, who got exactly what they deserved "
