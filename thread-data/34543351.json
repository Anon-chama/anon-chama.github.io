I know this is annoying but it's a consequence of doing things the way I do them: not using an API that requires a key. If you do it like this you're always on the back foot fixing up new edge-case scenarios that show up from time to time. You can use a more up to date version (now v0.4) which can be found here: \nhttps://pastebin.com/f4YM78MJ\nBecause I didn't expect to be updating this script, fixing new edge-case scenarios and shit like that, I didn't bother to make a git repo so I don't even remember what new changes I made by now, but I do know that Mahiru's and Charo's channel work now. I also added the possibility to add channels by channel name instead of channel ID, that is /c/ChannelName instead of /channel/CHANNELID, you can comment out channels you don't want to check but want to leave there for future reference. Also if the script finds 4 or more live streams it says \"ONGOING BATTLEROYALE\" instead of live streams. Hope it helps, anon. ",
