You don't have a purpose? Becoming the best version of yourself can be the starting point, once you reach that you'll already have a new one.\nAlso this rich guy you mentioned, I'm pretty sure he doesn't know about female nature and has an idolized image of women like most men nowadays. \nWomens in general are selfish beings as a whole (for biological reasons) they surely don't look like it but this is one of the main distinction they have with men since we are selfless by nature.\nBelieve me, once you know about how they really operate you'll get a big turn off and you'll reorganize your priorities in a big level. They're nice to have once you build your castle but rare are the cases when they help you building that castle, they just move in.... that's why they should never be your priority. Trying to get some good homeboys is also needed.\nBros before Hoes all the time. This quote is real shit. "
