Few would even bother posting about it if they couldn't latch onto political drama. Because that doesn't get (You)'s. Have one btw.\nSimilar to classic OP formula with on-topic or no-topic text with some twitter screenshot that intentionally inspires an extremely tangential but more flamebait topic. "
