If you saw the stream you'd know that Neon sounded very depressed, even counting the minutes until it was 60 minutes so she could log off.

If Neon stays in the company she may be very unhappy, as the the girls didn't sound very panchi panchi in their rm accounts, including Sezia. In my opinion, the best outcome is for the girls to be free from the manlet so they can pursue their own careers but that seems increasingly unlikely now. And the worst possible scenario is for Akira to keep Neon in limbo for 2 (two) fucking years, unable to pursue her own career but without streaming as Neon.\nPushing for Akira to allow the girls to renegotiate their contracts should have been our main objective but two things happened, first Hina showed up in her other account and that made a lot of people let a sigh of relief, completely forgetting that the other girls are (possibly) still trapped under a shitty contract. And the other thing that happened is that some autists on twitter redirected outrage to Lia, and that made a lot of people self reflect on the idea that they were harassing a girl and so they put down their pitchforks. Those retards effectively worked in Akira's favor, ironically. "
