You don't wanna mess with vtuber spic drama because it's not worth it in any way, not even for the memes, as it implies taking a side on a situation that is so petty and retarded. Both, the random whos that larp as vigilantes trying to \"cancel\" someone, and the creators who take them seriously and issue an apology instead of f'ing them off, are pathetic.\nPls If I want drama, bring something worth it like Mordo getting cancelled or Dross vs Badabun type of shit, that was interesting.

Just keep doing what you do and period.\nFuck this postmodern, globalistic culture where attention-craving zoomers think of the internet as their real life instead of a mean of entertainment, seeking some sort of approval from online communities and group identity, making creator based tribalism fill the online space. Now I get the nostalgia for the old internet and even stuff like momos, trolling and sdlg autism. Those were all made by kids, teens and retard adults having fun in a chaotic neutral way, but it was the chaddest use of the internet by far. No care for drama and no tribalism based on a feeling of moral superiority, just mere laidback fun. \nAnyways, ignore most of this post my second post as its my schizo mind talking, and save Hina from doing salseo streams, when criticizing without picking sides is the healthiest and most rational thing to do. Plus, it helps in damage control from the recent yabs from Akira. Remember, spic humour, memes and audience arent really the problem (its just (you) being \"unico y diferente\"). Spic drama is the enemy, as it invites more tribalism from foreign fandoms into the audience. "
