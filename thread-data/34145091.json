Later on the chuubas began giving more details about their number goals, like reaching 100k for a new model, my rrat is that they did this to combat the bad PR of the management pressure rrat and eventually chuubas themselves said the manlet relaxed a little with the numberfaggotry.\nWhy would you terminate a chuuba under your company? well, the mind of a manlet works in mysterious ways, but the chuubas mentioned Wactor pays for the covers at least, and if we're feeling extra rraty I could even imagine a monthly wage, so, if a chuuba is getting low numbers but Wactor still is contractually tied to pay for a cover it might not be worth it for both the talent and the manlet to renew it. \nsource: Trust me Bro.\n I used to watch the streams.\n "
