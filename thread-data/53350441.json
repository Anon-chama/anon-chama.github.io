However I didn't want to just make a random platformer \"without a reason\". An opportunity presented itself when Nisha was playing Only Up and she kept yelling \"BURGIR\" whenever she had to make a difficult jump. That gave me the idea of making a jumping game called Burgir Time (a reference to the game BurgerTime \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BurgerTime#Gameplay\n ) which by the way is heavily inspired by the game EverybodyEdits, did anyone play that?\nI put together a demo, collision detection is very wonky on the corners but it's a start. This might have a future. The game would most likely be called Nisha's Burgir Time. ",
