I really thought Pira\u00f1ita was cute with all the famboysh thing she had for the wactor girls and I got interested but every time I showed up to one of her streams I got pretty bored... She is just not that entertaining. The only good stream of hers that I recall watching was the b-day stream bc of all the emotions and even that got boring. Nothing against Pira\u00f1ita but if she really becomes the fantasmita it would be very disappointing. "
