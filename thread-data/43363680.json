Anons have suggested maybe she was caught talking to another agency or maybe she was in fact sick so she took leave but Akira got impatient with her.\n>>43371876\n>they all continued with their activity and future plans\nMaybe they all thought Hina would come back, but weeks went by and the conflict couldn't get resolved so they issued an ultimatum to bring back Hina or they riot. My reason to believe this is because when we first found Meica she very clearly stated \"I'm just here to show my hobbies\" in a story. Maybe at that point nothing was decided, everyone thought they would work things out and have Hina return. But then she realized she didn't have to start from scratch, so she didn't need Akira and she decided to fuck off for good, taking Luna with her. Neon was still trapped, though. I don't know what happened there. "
