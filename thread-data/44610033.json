That doesn't excuse harassing her or celebrating that she tried to an hero (whether real or not). After all, Akira was the one to GIVE HER preferential treatment. It all comes back to this guy, who is the person responsible for everything. I don't understand why people can't seem to grasp this simple idea. He has been doing everything wrong for who knows how long, and it all is starting to bite him in the ass and affecting people close to him, including Lia and even his mom. "
