Definitely Yes.\nLia said that. Is her menhera way to say if I can speak with them (bc of lenguage) and I like one of them I'll collab. So yes of course she is a whore.\nI agree with Miu and Yue \nLuna is complicated. She is inteligent enogh to realize the danger of this that might even result \nin loosing some gachi whales. And I'm pretty sure she already has a BF so I don't see her doing it unless her dumb instincts kicks in and gave in into the flow depending on how Akira want this to go.\nSame opinion with Pal, Himari and Fantasmita but be aware of Fantasmita.

Miu plays the long run, despite 14% she was clearly taken aback by donors passively protesting. Yue, she knew what she was getting into and despite her attempt to be a clown with that intro, is aware she\u2019s going to lose hard if she collab.\nThe rest are very likely to approach the guys even if they don\u2019t mention them. For Ito, she made it clear from the get go. Lia is going to do e-version of the sex for revenge thing, not joking. The two H girls are black holes of attention needs, so expect lots of unironic flirting. I believe the Kuma rrat, to me she\u2019s already lining her collabs. Ghost first need to solidify her cult fanbase before attempting to collab. \nDon\u2019t know about Pal and Luna, their design filter me. "
