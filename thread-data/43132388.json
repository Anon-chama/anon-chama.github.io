We had initially hoped the shitstorm would force Akira to allow the girls to renegotiate their contracts up to the ability to annul them, so they could pursue their own careers.

There's no way a Spanish or English speaking girl signs for them for the foreseeable future, though a few years down the road people might forget about the drama if they can survive that long.\nAlso the video linked above is hilarious if you look at the chat, people keep commenting things like \"what? there's more?!\" as the guy kept explaining the shitshow.
