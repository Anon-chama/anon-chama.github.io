I also need to pick some songs and make track timings for them. \nhttps://files.catbox.moe/ga5s8g.mp4\nI will be taking a break from this project, though, and maybe from this thread too because > drama. But we're getting there! \n>>49305929\nAnon this song is mighty annoying lmao. I honestly have no idea what songs I'm going to include. I'm already risking it by including Aidoru, although it's only an excerpt. The original idea comes from this tweet \nhttps://twitter.com/EruNabura/status/1651051816816193538#m\n so I have to include it but I don't want to include many copyrighted songs and risk getting my project banned from Github.
