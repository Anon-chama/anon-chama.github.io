So I tell maid-chan i wanted the male one. Character fit with personality, the lore i wrote blended perfectly with the concept, debut stream planned weeks ahead ,and even got new setup and couple games ready. And maid-chan gave some hints that i would get it. \nFast forwards to debut day, and the other guy debuts with male avatar. meanwhile i get a message from akira with drive link to a female avatar, script and details, and tells me to fake my voice. I panicked in desbelief, but gave it a try anyways. I grew anxious, debut was scuffed and ended up quite literally bailing minutes into my debut. \nAt least avatar was cute i think tho its design was kinda weird.\nBut it was made by notemama, so I got to be miu and lia's sister for a while at least ",
