Same goes when she tells her chat of a random everyday experience in Japan and the audience gets to say \"oh wow do they really do that in Japan?\".

        "content": " Alright, bilibili anon here. Wactor management made Mahiru's account today, and had her debut today too when she only has less than 500 subs. No idea what they're thinking. Not even promoted by other wactor mems too.\nAlso since I'm here, might as well disclose what I know from the bili side and correct some things:\n- Misora honestly wasn't doing bad in bili at all despite how little she streams. This is probably because she can chat, unlike say, Hanapyon. More total interactions than many small Jp v with higher subs. In bili chatting and singing is key (Misora def tried some karaoke there, and also video reacts). She also got some collabs with Nanoha and Mana, among two of biggest foreigners in bili, all thanks to Laila. Laila's ability to leech is uncanny. She also tried to reply to Hiiro's tweets and bili feeds, though she didn't respond. (Hiiro is the biggest female foreign v, anglophone who learned Chinese from scratch till she's proficient)\n- Also Misora isn't in Japan. This is publicly available info in bili. I'm not telling where though. You can blame the war in Ukraine and weibo sensationalists for this.\n- Contrary to what people here believe, Pal isn't Chinese. She puts a mark indicating she's foreigner in every stream. Ito too. Chinese mems are Yue (def from Guangdong) and Himari (from insular China under foreign backed puppet regime occupation, liberation soon). I don't think management's dumb enough to make a Chinese person pretend to be Japanese, bc one of Lia's friend did that and she got parodied and trolled super hard. Noone wanted to collab with her for almost a year until an equally bitchy ex-bigbadcorpo who also mocked her did.\n- Speaking of collab blacklist, one former member of wactor subtitle team revealed that wactor have a collab blacklist. He said that Kokonoe Yukari (has collabed with Suzu before) was in it. After that was revealed of course they announced a collab with Yukari the next day. Whether it is a hasty damage control or a false gossip at the very first place, you judge it yourself.\n- Miu has been stuck at 65k-ish subs in bili for more than a year. This is definitely bc she doesn't have live translator and subtitle group and wactor is too cheap to get one or edit her vids in house. Lia at least have occassional volunteer translation (though not in every stream) and uh, the contents.\n- Suzu is big in bili because of no language barrier, good feed updates, good interaction, and most importantly, very high trust with the Chinese audience (which Akira tried to ruin), Some big superchats were given by people who otherwise only trust and watch domestic Vups, except for her, her friend Mojuko, and foreign V who earnestly learned Chinese (not duolingo shit). Speaking of Mojuko, she's her good friend, also a big Jp V who speaks Chinese, collabs with her often, and sadly retired around the same time as Suzu bc of mental health. Seems like a bad case of depression + dissociative disorder. Damn. So two among the biggest left, and there's a gap for foreign v who speaks Chinese but honestly, I don't think Pal fills that gap.\n- wactor gamers and males auditions/announcements were not posted in bili.
