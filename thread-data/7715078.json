        "content": " \n>>7725535\nI have no doubt that there is an element of jealousy or resentment in every one of the girls at Wactor. However, whether it simply is healthy amounts of workmate competitive drive or an insidious growing danger is a far more complex question. \nIf we remain logical, it would be obvious that every single girl seeks to be the \"main girl\" and, therefore, they all now that, in the current situation, they must speak Spanish to stand a chance against the giant that is Sopita. \nWe do not really know whether Wactor's targeting of Iberoamerica came as a result of Sopita's high level or if, on the other hand, Sopita just so happened to find herself in the most fortunate situation when debuting. \nConsider Wactor's Gen 0 and 1: were the girls briefed on their strong push for the Iberoamerican market? If so, were they given proper Spanish lessons? We can only believe they did not, otherwise that would mean the girls were simply lazy. \nI do not know anything about the girls' roommates, but having listened to Liu's ASMR voice packs I would not be surprised if they came from DLsite or something similar; the girls in that market are rather vile at times.\nIt's quite transparent how comfortable Sopita is with the chat. She jokes around, is lovely and, most importantly, she understands close to everything a chat full of autistic people from 20 different Spanish-speaking countries throws at her. Conversely, every other Wactor girl struggles massively with the language and is, for all intents and purposes, a Japanese streamer which speaks a couple of Iberoamircan idioms here and there. Even if the JP girls wanted to be Japanese-only streamers, Wactor's push has completely filled their chats with a language they do not understand. \nThen, go back to Sopita. Consider all that I said and now look at this extremely successful (not by Wactor standards, but by any chuuba standards) trilingual girl who has already made 15.000\u20ac in supas in a couple of months (figures which crush most of Nijisanji's streams month-by-month) and which has already captivated Wactor's target audience.\nThe only girl on the same ballpark of supas is Miu, but she debuted three years ago. Hoshina's numbers are not even listed on PlayBoard, but I am certain she should have met all requirement for supas to be activated.\nI lack information regarding the retirement of all other Wactor girls, but their list does not paint a great picture with already six girls out of the company.\n>numbers numbers numbers\nI know discussing numbers has bad connotations, but we must not forget these girls are do not have the financial stability of the Holos or the main Nijigirls. Sopita's case is the exception; if these numbers are kept (not even increased, just maintained) she will be running at 80k within a single year.\nIf my opinion is worth anything, I'd say that the health of the girls' relationship with one another depends on how much the Spanish language is being forced upon the talent. Do the girls really wish to speak the language and basically forego Japan? This is a legitimate approach, but I do not know whether this is the girls' real desire. \nIf Spanish is simply a recommendation from Wactor and they can choose to remain JP, then it should be obvious, even to the most envious of girls, that Sopita is simply making use of her assets and there are no hard-feelings involved.

She has received an average of 7.166\u20ac in supas since February of 2018.\nShizuka Rin, who debuted on the same month as Mito, has an average of 5.439\u20ac in supas every month.\nUtako Suzuka debuted a month later, on March of 2018 and she has an average supa amount of 4.873\u20ac.\nOur baby, Sopita, stands at an average of 4.921\u20ac in supas. \nLia's average supa amount is 468\u20ac. She debuted on December of 2019. \nLaila's is at 980\u20ac. She debuted on May of this year, and at the beginning on the month, while Sopita debuted at the very end.\nPikoyo debuted alongside Lia and she is at 296\u20ac on average.\nMiu debuted on October of 2018 and pushes 624\u20ac on supas on average.\nI'll cut it there for comparisons.\nStreaming schedule is also important but that would be too much to look at for now.\nI also lack very critical information regarding the banner some of the girls have which claims \"supported by bilibili\". Do the girls have bilibili accounts they have chosen not to list anywhere in their profiles? Is bilibili paying them a salary? "

And the others enjoy some steady growth.\nI can only imagine how Miu, Lia, Hana and the others would feel seeing New girls getting more attention because they were better prepared. Maybe they dont are jealous, but I can understand them if they feel in disadvantage. I can only hope this doesnt implode with the arrival of gen 3.\nFor now, recently wactor's fan discord started pinging @everyone when any of the giros goles live, so even if there are majority of x girl fans all the people is aware of all the talents.
