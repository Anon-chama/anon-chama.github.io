I'm one of the Anons who keep making this general. The reason is simple: I would like to discuss Meica and Nisha in the context of the shit they've been through but also because I haven't forgotten about Neon and Sezia. I wanted an umbrella term to discuss all the girls I wanted to discuss, namely Hina, Luna, Neon, Sezia and Himea without resorting to some sort of /spic/ or /\u00f1/ general, since that would undoubtedly invite discussion of other companies and indies like Sedai, Amai, and even things like Nimu which I'm not interested in. /wactor/ satisfies all of these requirements with ease.\nAnd although I was initially adamant that the split shouldn't have been made, now I urge you to stay in your containment thread since now it is obvious that, one: the shitter comes from your thread as evidenced by yesterday's blunder where he mistakenly posted his bait in the other thread first, and two: both the imagespammer and the choripaschizo are both hardcore misopitas and now that your containment thread exists, we no longer have to deal with that shit.\nI am fine with a smaller and slower general, I don't care if it doesn't survive the night. I (or MiutomoOP or whoever) will make one in the morning. And just to clarify, just because this general is /wactor/ doesn't mean we support Akira or the company itself, WE SUPPORT THE GIRLS. \n---\nBut also I will say this, once MiutomoOP returns I will not be making any more threads. If MiutomoOP quits again then maybe there won't be anyone to make new /wactor/ threads and you can rename to whatever you want. "
