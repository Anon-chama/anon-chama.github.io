        "content": " \n>>35341241\nYeah I think you're mostly right.\n>she always invents a thousand excuses to leave for long periods of time\nHimea does tend to take quite a lot of unexpected breaks from time to time, and she tends to cancel streams unexpectedly. \nI don't think she has an idea how much this affect her in the long run, this little breaks just make it hard for her to build a close relationship with her audience which is very important if you want to enjoy what you're doing because if you don't enjoy what you're doing you'll not wanna make streams and that will be reflected in your attitude while streaming and so on and so on... It just like a domino effect from there.\nConsistency is extremely important for any streamer and she has done a poor job on that. I kinda understand tho, she started strong but with so many limitations it's normal to get discouraged quickly but even so that's not a fucking excuse either, she has to show up for fuck sake, at least if she wants to keep doing this and grow while she is at it. \n>she's n't charismatic\nNow I do think she is very charismatic, she has an unique charm that I haven't seen in any other women period. She is a total dork, but not an otaku dork, just a dork of very weird things. \nThis also leads to why she is so awkward all the time while interacting with others.\nI always wondered why was that but I think she is the kind of person that only shines when she gets comfortable with someone. When not, she tries to give a good impression with a facade that honestly seems quite unnatural some times. \nEven with Kuuma she seems nervous while talking. Probably why she doesn't reach out to other people that much.\nGet along with others is a very important skill she need upgrade little by little starting with the colleagues that she can interact the most. \nI just hope they don't hold a grudge for her. I don't think Hina does but I do fear Luna actually hates her or at least don't like her. I mean, they didn't interact much to begin with even before we \"shill\" Himea here (probably bc they didn't reach out each other) but now...\nIf Luna read the threads from time to time I can imagine why she would grow a dislike for her since she would think that she does what we told her to but let's be honest, that's not the truth..The only reason why she followed the marshmallow advice was because the coomer bait kind of content got way out of hand and she was starting to get uncomfortable with the messages she received but she thought that was the content people expected from her (there womens who can handle this type of content but I don't think himea is one of them)\nWhen she saw that a bunch of people didn't just like her for the coomer bait shit and gave her ideas for streams without the need of a graphic she got super happy and emotional. \nTo me she is just a person that wants to to things right but have no fucking idea on what's she is doing and so she needs some type of guidance in oder to keep going but she just didn't get to have such guidance whatsoever. She didn't have a discord group full of groomers like Hina did back in the day that even helped her with edits and also advice her on what to do and it's clear that she didn't have previous experience as an enterteiner like Luna.\nHer mistake was probably not reaching out to her sempais for advice from the beginning. Someone so consistent like Luna would've helped her out a lot or even Hina who at the time had way more experience after so many fuck ups.\nI don't know if Luna really dislike her or if it's just another rrat but even if she does I hope she is the kind of person who can forgive and forget. I would love to see them get along with each other bc I think Luna can be a great sempai given the chance from what we know about Hina (even tho she is the kohai there)but definitely there's need of effort from both sides given their personalities... (Oh there also another aspect involved in the posible conflict but I won't get in there)\nHimea is not absolve from all fault in any way but she is not a bad girl either. She seems to want to get better and she also seems to be passionate on what she does... some times more than others. I hope she can do better because in all honesty it's about time. \nThere alot of other stuff to analyze from her but overall those are the main issues right now. "
