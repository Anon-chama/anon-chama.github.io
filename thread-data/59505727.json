Oh my God.\nI can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little /P\u00d1G/ thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don\u2019t even fill in the captcha. Maybe you\u2019re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the pun. The \u201cepic\u201d \u00d1 joke, isn\u2019t it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it\u2019s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that\u2019s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she\u2019s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about some fucking spic vtubers. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic splitnigger NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can\u2019t even try to talk with you because all you say is \u201cREAL THREAD\u201d You\u2019ve become a parody of your own self. And that\u2019s all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he\u2019s done a million times now. And that\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever be. "
