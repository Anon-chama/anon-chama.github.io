We only a gen 2 marshmallow stream ages ago and was mostly for suzu.\nThose kind of collab to know them better was what i was looking forward the most when sopa was confirmed as a spanish speaker and even after more than half a year we never got it.\nThe few collabs we had were luna and her genmates which was okay and sopa with lia that was too afraid to translate anything. It doesnt help the rivalry they have resulting in them being more comfortable in collabing with outsiders, especially these last few months. Even miu does that, but i doubt its her not wanting to collab and she was already doing that before the spanish thing i would think.\n>they are not friends!! They are coworkers!!!\nAt least do it for the audience that wants to know more, and its nice content replacement for all the meme review number n+1. That way for example you have people knowing rose more and stopping with the akuma tenshi thing because they have more to talk about her. "
