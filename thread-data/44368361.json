Meaning that Akira tried this before, they told him they couldn't do shit since Latam and just decided to put the paper there just to doxx Meica.

When you sue someone you have to notify, but there is nothing like a \"denuncia\", he just did that out of spite.\nSadly, Paraguay's gob websites suck, so I could only partially read that law in Vlex and yes, these are indeed \"datos sensibles\", since racial origins are involved.\nSpanish warning.\nAhora, esto \u00faltimo no tiene nada que ver con la acci\u00f3n civil por incumplimiento de contrato. Como dije antes, es altamente probable que te echen abajo la cl\u00e1usula penal por el monto excesivo y por lo poco claro que es el incumplimiento que la detona, pero eso no excluye que te puedan demandar de indemnizaci\u00f3n de perjuicios por el incumplimiento (en ese caso, hay que acreditar los perjuicios, esa es la desventaja para el enano). En todo caso, un juez hasta podr\u00eda considerar que por la relaci\u00f3n de subordinaci\u00f3n y dependencia, esto es materia laboral y ah\u00ed cambia totalmente el asunto. "
