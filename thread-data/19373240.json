I remember perfectly than rather than focusing on the sexual aspect of the scene I was playing more with the environment and its shade overlapping with the muffled sounds of the atrocity.\nIn the end I had to take a break while writing the final parts, the following months after the rape. I was of course conscious of what I wrote, but rather than feeling bad about the content I felt sicked at its beauty, a fine craft with a hideous shape, something ephemeral truly meant to be for oneself.\nI purged it, I deleted the files, deleted the cloud copy, for several days I wrote other stuff to forget about it, it was unfair to the thread but even more unfair to me.\nOh Sopa, you are truly wonderful\nYou truly brought the best worst part of me "
