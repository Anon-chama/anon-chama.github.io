Remember she said upgrading her PC would take around 3 months. She still has two months to go, and is already depleting most of her lifelines: anniversary stream, reacting to hashtags, reacting to clips, freechat. On top of that, there's one latam culture collab left, and she can't even run Cat Mario. IT'S FUCKING CAT MARIO. JUST HOW FFS??\nIf she's creative enough to hold still, then props to her; if her fanbase doesn't get tired, then that'll be quite convenient. Sigh, at least she'll eventually be pressured to finish DDLC as last resort, so it's a win i guess (?). No it really isn't...\nIn one month she has collected $10k in SC, which could mean $3k in total revenue for her. Considering that she lives in the middle of nowhere rural japan, that she steals electricty and wifi from her neighbor, how much money and time will it take for her to at least use her live2D avatar as it was supposed to be?
