We couldn't understand Kaichou and Kaichou couldn't understand us... \nIn the end, this was like Merum's case where she got tired and frustrated with us and tried to escape from it going to the Japanese audience where she clearly feels more comfortable. \nThis now is also evident seeing Kaichou reducing her spanish's streams 1 day per week. Understandable since we are not what she is aiming for anymore but now she is trying to get to work with the J Futbol leagues as a Vtuber and get closer to her Japanese fanbase.\nOnce again we were some kind of a stephing stone it seems...\nMaybe she was too Japanese for us?
